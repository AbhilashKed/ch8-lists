    "Images are represented by computers as 2-dimensional grids of colored points called [pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel). Each pixel stores the color of the picture at that particular point in the grid. Computer colors are based on three components (or channels): a red component, a green component and a blue component. Each component is an integer with a value from 0 to 255 (1 byte). If all components are 0, the color ends up being black. If all components are 255, the color is white. Other combinations give other colors. You can see one example of how different channels combine [here](http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm). This method of specifying colors (there are other methods too!) is called 'RGB' for \"red green blue\".\n",
